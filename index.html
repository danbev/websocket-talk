					<h1>Why WebSockets?</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's look into how we arrived to where we are today...

					<aside class="notes">
						The need for more advanced responses, images, content negotiation.
						content encoding, character set support, multi-part types, authorization, caching, proxy behaviors, date formats, and more
						Requiring a new TCP connection per request imposes a significant performance penalty on HTTP 1.0
						(HTTP/1.0 -> new connection for every request unless 'Connection: keep-alive' is sent. Not part of the 1.0 spec)
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>HTTP 1.1</h1>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">RFC-2068 1997</li>

						<li class="fragment">Keep-alive</li>
						<li class="fragment">Chunked encoding transfers</li>
						<li class="fragment">Still half duplex</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						keepalive allows us to reuse the existing TCP connection for multiple requests to the same host and deliver a much faster end-user experience
						keepalive is the default in 1.1 but was backported to 1.0 by using 'Connection: Keep-Alive'
						Called 'persistent' connection, because the connection persists across multiple requests. 

						Official spec in 1997 and then a number of improvements in 1999.

						Introduced pipelining (but not really relavent to this disucssion)
						There is also  pipelining where multiple requests can be send to the server and not have to wait for a response before sending the next request.
						The advantage is that multiple requests can be sent in one go. The server must send back the responses in the same order though.

						Comet is a web application model in which a long-held HTTP request allows a web server to push data to a browser, without the browser explicitly requesting it

						The new term was a play on Ajax (Ajax and Comet both being household cleaners common in the USA).

					<aside class="notes">
						Origin
						Same idea as Origin for browsers and allows a server to restrict which web pages can contact the server.
						Obviously, this model does not work from other clients (no browser) as they can simply add any origin they like.

						Upgrade 
						Is used to indicate that we want to "upgrade" to WebSocket. This is a little odd as we are not upgrading at all, infact we are going
						to be using WebSocket instead of HTTP over TCP. But the 'Upgrade' header was made for extenstion and at the time probably for upgrading to a newer HTTP 
						version or for upgrading to TLS.

						The 'Upgrade' header is hop-by-hop, it is/should not passed through proxies. 
						By specifying 'Connection: upgrade' proxies are forced to parse this header and remove any headers listed. Connection is for this connection only not 
						for the end-to-end connection.

						Connection
						HTTP/1.1 proxies MUST parse the Connection header field before a message is forwarded and, for each connection-token in this field, remove any header 
						field(s) from the message with the same name as the connection-token.
						Some proxy servers might not understand the Connection header and not remove the headers listed. Let's say that we send an upgrade request to such a proxy server.
						Client -> proxy -> server
						* In this case the client sends the upgrade request to the proxy, expecting a websocket to be create if the upgrade is successful.
						* The proxy server creates a connection to the target server and forwards the request, including all headers.
						* The server does not know about the proxy but just sees a upgrade request and so handles it. Responding with the correct response will keep the socket open.
						* The proxy server handles the response from the server and "forwards" it back to the client. For the client this looks like a successful upgrade to a WebSocket
						* When the client javascript tries to send using the web socket, the proxy server will not know how to handle it, this does not look like a HTTP request, and 
						will most probably be dropped or an error returned and the connection closed.

						Sec-WebSocket-Version
						Although draft versions of this document (-09, -10, -11, and -12) were posted (they were mostly comprised of editorial changes and clarifications and not 
						changes to the wire protocol), values 9, 10, 11, and 12 were not used as valid values for Sec-WebSocket-Version. These values were reserved in the IANA 
						registry but were not and will not be used.

						Sec-WebSocket-Key.  
						Is a random 16 bytes value that is base64 encoded. And used to prevent cross protcol attacks. There is nothing stopping someone from intercepting this
						header, base64 decoding it and they would have the ran
						This is really not to prevent attacks on WebSocket servers but instead agains non-WebSocket server. If this did not exist the browser could possible be
						tricked into opening a TCP connection (by issuing a forged upgrade request) to a non-websocket server (in this case we have to imagine that there is now
						Sec-WebSocket-Accept part of the protocol).

						Several header names are reserved by browsers for platform-level usage in the XMLHttpRequest specification and thus are off-limits for use in applications. 
						The setRequestHeader(header, value) of the XMLHttpRequest object will terminate if one of these headers are used (see link), among these are:
						* Connection
						* Host
						* Origin
						* Upgrade
						or if the start of header is a case-insensitive match for Proxy- or Sec-.
						http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#dom-xmlhttprequest-setrequestheader

						These header names include those starting with Sec-, as well as common security-critical headers like referer, host, and cookie.
						The new headers defined in RFC 6455 are all prefixed with Sec-. These prefixes are so named because the browser is opening WebSocket connections on behalf of applications, 
						but the low-level, security sensitive parameters in the handshake are off-limits to application code. This effectively locks down upgrade requests so that they can only be 
						made through APIs like the WebSocket constructor and not through general HTTP APIs like XMLHttpRequest.

					<aside class="notes">
						For example, this could be a request crafted and sent from a browser. It would have the correct handshake header
						as it would still be using the WebSocket object but the target server would not be a WebSocket server.
						Instead the target server would running a different protocol and by having the browser send this request might
						get that server to take action. But to actually send data to that server a connection would first have to be established.
						But a server that does not understand WebSocket would not respond with the correct Sec-WebSocket-Accept header and hence the
						browser will close the connection.

						Masking is done to prevent cross-protocol attacks when an intermediate is in the picture. 
						For example, if there is a transparent/intercepting proxy in the communication path the first WebSocket upgrade might succeed and a WebSocket connection established. 
						But if the WebSocket client crafted a TextFrame that looks like a HTTP request this could be interpreted by the proxy as a HTTP request and acted upon. 

						Lets say that the protocol did not use masking. The initial handshake goes as planned but the intermediate does not understand the websocket protocol.
						The client thinks that it was a connection open (which is now does to the proxy server) but instead of sending "normal" data it sends what resembles
						a HTTP request:

					Extensions are so named because they extend the WebSocket Protocol. Extensions can add new opcodes and data fields to the framing format. 
					You may find it more difficult to deploy a new extension than a new protocol (or “subprotocol”) because browser vendors must explicitly build in support for these extensions. 
					You’ll probably find it much easier to write a JavaScript library that implements a protocol than to wait for all browser vendors to standardize an extension and all users to update their browsers to the version supporting that extension.
